  <h1>Dimitrios Dafos</h1>
  <p><em>IT Support Specialist and System Administrator.</em></p>
  <br>
  <p>My career started with training as an IT system electronics technician.<br>
    I got to know the basis of IT and was able to plan and build complete <br>
    IT infrastructures in numerous projects. It quickly became clear to me <br>
    that there were still many opportunities to implement in IT. I attended <br>
    courses that offered certifications.</p>
  <p>My experience grew and it quickly became clear that in IT the process of <br>
    learning is an essential part of daily work. The responsibility and complexity <br>
    of the projects grew and I also got the opportunity to lead and design small <br>
    teams. My reputation as a mentor is also in demand and my opinion is valued.</p>
  <p>My ambition to be able to prove an academic degree was great and it was <br>
    therefore only a matter of time before I attended and successfully completed <br>
    my studies in business information technology. Here I not only deepened the <br>
    economic aspect of IT, but also had the opportunity to learn more in-depth <br>
    psychological approaches that enrich the handling of employees in management <br>
    positions.</p>
